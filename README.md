Just a few notes I’d like you all to review.

As the author, I request everyone to be mindful and verify carefully.

I don’t think I need to explain what needs to be verified — I trust you’ll understand.
I hope each of you passes this small test of comprehension.

When making changes, please clearly mention them in the commit message and description.

Also, remember: the questions provided are only for reference and may differ from what appears in your own system.

Thank you all!
